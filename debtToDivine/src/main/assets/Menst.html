	<li>These are days you have menstruated or had post natal bleeding during the time you have specified in the Debt Total.</li>
	<li>These menstruation and lochia days will be subtracted from the total debt when making up missed prayers.</li>
	<li>This option is only available when the Gender option is set to <b>'Female'</b>.</li>
	<li>This value only has effect when the debt type is <b>'Prayer'</b>.</li>
	<li><B>NOTE:</B></li> 
		<ul style="margin-left:1.5em;padding-left:0px">
			<li>If you select a value whose total menses and lochia days is more than the total or remaining debt, the app will revert the value to the highest possible total menstrual and lochia days.</li>
			<li>e.g. I have a total debt of 5 years (60 months);<BR> 
                I have 121 days remaining;<BR> 
                I select 5 days per day menstruation (5 x 60 = 300);<BR> 
                The average will revert to 2 days (2 x 60 = 120);<BR> 
                Which is less than or equal to the remaining days;<BR>
                I now have 1 day remaining.</li>
            <li>Also you cannot choose a number of menses and lochia days that is more than would have been possible to menstruate or bleed post natal (on average every year) in the duration you have selected as Debt Total.</li>
            <li>The highest possible menstrual days is calculated to be 15 days of every month owed.</li>
            <li>The highest possible lochia days is 40 days (for Hanafi) or 60 days (for Shafii) for every year owed in the Debt Total.</li>
