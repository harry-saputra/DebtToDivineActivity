<h2 style="color:#2D5AC3;font-size:14px;">Debt Total Information</h2>
<ul style="margin-left:1.5em;padding-left:0px">
	<li>Here you select your total debt owed to Allah (Mighty and Majestic is He).</li>
	<li>Before setting this value, think back to the times you most likely would have missed prayers or fasts and write down how many days, months and/or years you believe you owe.  Add a little more to that value to give yourself certainty that making up this amount will clear all your debt.</li>
    <li><b>Prayer and Fasting</b></li>
		<ul style="margin-left:1.5em;padding-left:0px">
			<li>The dialog that appears when you have chosen a Prayer or Fasting debt type will have 3 bars:</li>
			<li>The first bar you can select the number of years you wish to make up.</li>
			<li>The second bar you can select the number of months you wish to make up.</li>
			<li>The third bar you can select the number of days you wish to make up.</li>
            <li>The app will tally up the total number of days and this will be displayed on the home page.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><B>NOTE:</B></li> 
		<ul style="margin-left:1.5em;padding-left:0px">
			<li>You cannot set a total debt less than what you have already made up, the selection wheel will auto revert to the lowest possible debt total when you try to select anything less.</li>
