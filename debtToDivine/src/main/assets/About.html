    <p>
    There is hardly one of us who has not missed a few prayers or prayed them incorrectly at one time or another, the righteous scholars of Islam are unanimous in agreement about the obligatory nature of making up missed prayers.  All four of the madhhabs (schools of thought) in Islam deem it obligatory to make up missed prayers (Reliance of the traveller, w18.1).
    <p>
    </p>
    This app is designed to aid those wanting to keep track of their missed prayers and make them up thus repaying their debt to the Divine. 
    It may also be used for missed fasts and other forms of worship one wishes to make up.
    <p>
    </p>
    The free version allows only one profile, however an In-App Purchase is enabled to allow you to unlock the ability to add more than one profile, such that you can keep track of other forms of worship or even another's debt to the Divine. Unlocking the full version also allows you to also keep track of individual prayers (Witr prayer is included for Hanafis). You may have made up more of an individual prayer than another, so on that screen you can adjust accordingly.
